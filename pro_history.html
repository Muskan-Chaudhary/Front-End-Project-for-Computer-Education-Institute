in Pridmont, Italy on August 6 1815. From a very young age he decided that he had been called to work for the poor
 boys of that era Europe was under the grip of the industrial Revolution, and many young people who came to the cities
 to study in search of fall on the many social evils of the time. After being ordained a priest of the Catholic Church in 1841, 
Don Bosco came to the rescue of these poor boys with his noble method of education of their lives and problems.
<br/>
To sure that his total dedication to tier cause shone through his action, he based his education on the three great principles 
of Reason Religion and Loving-Kindness, loving those to whom he dedicated his life, as a caring father and doing everything 
possible for their welfare. Don Bosco was attained to the needs of his society. He did not visualize education in isolation up were 
as integral to Don Bosco’s scheme of things as they are in modern education.
<br/>

 is the system that is used in DON BOSCO YOUTH CENTRE. Joseph Zoppio, the Swiss education said “if there even existed a method
 of education and adopted to inspire confidence and love, it is a method of Don Bosco.” The system aims to create a generation young
 men and women steeped not only in a social knowledge-based education but also in a strong value-based education for life</font>
